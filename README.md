# Geogame

The project is a simple geographic game made using React and CSS. In includes a countries search engine, a games in which you have to guess flags, capitals and regions of the countries. It has 3 difficult levels, depending on how much points have you earn. In the future I plan to add a quiz with interactive maps.
